I'll add my Rails templates here.

Not sure if these will be any use to anyone except me (or except as examples).

To use this, run

    bash -s < <( curl https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/rails-templates/raw/master/rails.sh ) yourapp

## Contents

* Rails 3 with MySQL
* Formtastic
* Compass (optional)
*
* RSpec + Cucumber test harness
